[{"categories":null,"contents":"his tutorial provides the reader with a basic tutorial how to perform a Bayesian regression in Blavaan, using Stan instead of Jags as a MCMC sampler. You can find the Blavaan Jags tutorial here. We will not delve into the the differences between Stan and Jags here (a technical explanation can be found here and a more accessible blog post here). For now it suffices to say that Stan is more efficient, especially for complex models. While using Blavaan the biggest difference is how you specify the priors. Instead of using a variance, as in Jags, Stan uses standard deviations.\nThroughout this tutorial, the reader will be guided through importing data files, exploring summary statistics and regression analyses. Here, we will exclusively focus on Bayesian statistics.\nIn this tutorial, we start by using the default prior settings of the software. In a second step, we will apply user-specified priors, and if you really want to use Bayes for your own data, we recommend to follow the WAMBS-checklist, also available in other software.\n","permalink":"https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/tutorials/blavaan-regression-stan/","tags":["Blavaan","tutorial","Bayesian","Stan"],"title":"Bayesian Regression in Blavaan (Using Stan)"},{"categories":null,"contents":"In this tutorial you follow the steps of the When-to-Worry-and-How-to-Avoid-the-Misuse-of-Bayesian-Statistics – checklist the WAMBS-checklist.

Users are asked to specify their plausible parameter space and their expected prior means and uncertainty around these means. The PhD-delay example, which is used as example in most other tutorials on this website, has been used an easy-to-go introduction to Bayesian inference. In this example the linear and quadratic effect of age on PhD-delay are estimated. Users learn about the interaction between a linear and a quadratic effect in the same model, about how to think about plausible parameter spaces, and about specification of normally distributed priors for regression coefficients. More information about the data and the model can be found here.\nMore information can be found here and the app can be found here\n","permalink":"https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/projects/pps/","tags":["R shiny","tutorial","Bayesian"],"title":"Plausible Parameter Space, a R Shiny App"},{"categories":null,"contents":"This tutorial provides the reader with a basic tutorial how to perform a regression analysis in lavaan.
