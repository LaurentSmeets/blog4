      <title>Bayesian Regression in Blavaan (Using Stan)</title>

      <description>his tutorial provides the reader with a basic tutorial how to perform a Bayesian regression in Blavaan, using Stan instead of Jags as a MCMC sampler. You can find the Blavaan Jags tutorial here. We will not delve into the the differences between Stan and Jags here (a technical explanation can be found here and a more accessible blog post here). For now it suffices to say that Stan is more efficient, especially for complex models.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial you follow the steps of the When-to-Worry-and-How-to-Avoid-the-Misuse-of-Bayesian-Statistics – checklist (the WAMBS-checklist) for the multilevel model from the book Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications, Chapter 2 In this manual the software package BRMS, version 2.3.1 for R (Windows) was use. This is part 3 of a 3 part series.</description>

      <title>BRMS tutorial: the Influence of Priors</title>
      <link>https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/tutorials/brms-priors/</link>

      <guid>https://LaurentSmeets.github.io/tutorials/brms-priors/</guid>
      <description>This tutorial shows how you can replicate the popularity data multilevel models from the book Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications, Chapter 2, while using different priors. In this manual the software package BRMS, version 2.3.1 for R (Windows) was used. You will be playing around with the options in BRMS to adjust the priors as opposed to using the default prior settings as we used in the BRMS Tutorial. This is part 2 of a 3 part series.</description>

      <title>Building a Bayesian Multilevel Model in BRMS Tutorial: Popularity Data</title>

      <description>This tutorial shows how you can replicate the popularity data multilevel models from the book Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications, Chapter 2. In this manual the software package BRMS, version 2.3.1 for R (Windows) was used. Results should be very similar to results obtained with other software packages, however due to convergence and rounding issues, you might notice minor differences. This is part 1 of a 3 part series</description>
