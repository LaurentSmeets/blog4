      <description>In this tutorial you follow the steps of the When-to-Worry-and-How-to-Avoid-the-Misuse-of-Bayesian-Statistics â€“ checklist (the WAMBS-checklist) for the multilevel model from the book Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications, Chapter 2 In this manual the software package BRMS, version 2.3.1 for R (Windows) was use. This is part 3 of a 3 part series.</description>

      <description>This tutorial shows how you can replicate the popularity data multilevel models from the book Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications, Chapter 2, while using different priors. In this manual the software package BRMS, version 2.3.1 for R (Windows) was used. You will be playing around with the options in BRMS to adjust the priors as opposed to using the default prior settings as we used in the BRMS Tutorial. This is part 2 of a 3 part series.</description>

      <description>This tutorial shows how you can replicate the popularity data multilevel models from the book Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications, Chapter 2. In this manual the software package BRMS, version 2.3.1 for R (Windows) was used. Results should be very similar to results obtained with other software packages, however due to convergence and rounding issues, you might notice minor differences. This is part 1 of a 3 part series</description>
