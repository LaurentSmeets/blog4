This tutorial shows how you can replicate the popularity data multilevel models from the book [Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications](https://multilevel-analysis.sites.uu.nl/), Chapter 2. In this manual the software package [BRMS, version 2.3.1](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html) for R (Windows) was used. Results should be very similar to results obtained with other software packages, however due to convergence and rounding issues, you might notice minor differences. This is part 1 of a 3 part [series](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/brms/)
