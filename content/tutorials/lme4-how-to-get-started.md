This document shows how you can replicate the popularity data multilevel models from the book [Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications](https://multilevel-analysis.sites.uu.nl/), Chapter 2. In this tutorial, the software packages [LME4](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/index.html) and [lmerTest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmerTest/index.html) for R (Windows) were used. Results should be very similar to results obtained with other software packages, however due to convergence and rounding issues, you might notice minor differences.
