This tutorial shows how you can replicate the popularity data multilevel models from the book [Multilevel analysis: Techniques and applications](https://multilevel-analysis.sites.uu.nl/), Chapter 2, while using different priors. In this manual the software package [BRMS, version 2.3.1](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html) for R (Windows) was used. You will be playing around with the options in BRMS to adjust the priors as opposed to using the default prior settings as we used in the BRMS Tutorial. This is part 2 of a 3 part  [series](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/tutorials/brms/).
